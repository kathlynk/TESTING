Congrats ðŸŽ‰! You completed all of the required steps for the first lab. In this lab you built a simple implementation of the flashcards app and learned how to layout views on a storyboard, connect them to code, and how to push your code to Github.

If you're feeling adventurous, check out the [optional steps](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/mobile_app_design/pages/ios/labs/lab_2_optionals) for this lab to start pushing the limits of your app.
